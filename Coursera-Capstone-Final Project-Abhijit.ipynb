They have a fixed budget that will allow them to open 5 to 8 outlets in the first year, and their management must be able to show traction in the first year as to be able to expand the business in the subsequent years. The management after initial reviews decided on the following high level criteria\n\n- The neighborhoods must have existing pizza outlets\n- Pizza outlets must be within the top 5 most common venues\n- The neighborhoods satisfying the above conditions to be ranked venues per 10k population (lowest to highest). The management would select the 5-8 neighborhoods with the lowest venues per 10k population"
